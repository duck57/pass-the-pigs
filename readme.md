# Pass the Pigs

## Files

* `pig.txt` and `pig.dat.txt` are the attribution+explanation and raw data, respectively
* `summary.py` generates a summary report of the raw data
* `summary.txt` is the result of `summary.py` being run on `pig.dat.txt`.  It is further split into `scores.tsv` and `positions.tsv` for individual analysis.
